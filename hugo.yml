      I am software developer with a passion for computer science. I love programming after hours and doing side projects just to expand my knowledge. 
      
      Besides programming my hobbies include various outdoor activities such as mountainbiking, rock climbing, freeride skitouring or serving neapolitan pizzas to my friends.
      
      On daily basis I work with various technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Big Data stuff, SQL, NoSQL, Containerization and cloud things.
