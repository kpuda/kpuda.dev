# [JC-Academy](https://www.jc-academy.pl)

[JC-Academy](https://www.jc-academy.pl) is my personal project to mentor ambitious people who wants to elevate their
skillset or just want to join IT industry. I teach both complete beginners and programmers who need help in further
development.

I am a self-taught developer, so I know what challenges stand in the way of people trying to get into the IT industry,
both from the student level and from completely changing the industry.

I really enjoy teaching programming because it is my way to share my passion and help others learn. It's rewarding to
empower people, encourage critical thinking, and build a supportive community. Watching my students progress and land
their dream jobs in IT is the best feeling.

Since beginning of my journey I taught 20 people who landed their first jobs or internships in various of companies.
Additionally 4 people have been able to promote from junior to mid level. There are many more on the way.
