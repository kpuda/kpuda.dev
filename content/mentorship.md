# [JC-Academy](https://www.jc-academy.pl)

[JC-Academy](https://www.jc-academy.pl) is my personal project to mentor ambitious people who wants to elevate their skillset or just want to join IT industry. I teach both complete beginners and programmers who need help in further development.

# Why
I really enjoy teaching programming because it is my way to share my passion and help others learn. It's rewarding to empower people, encourage critical thinking, and build a supportive community. Watching my students progress and land their dream jobs in IT is the best feeling.
